# Order Service Microservice

The **Order Service** microservice is part of a distributed system that handles order management. It communicates with a payment service to process payments and manages the order lifecycle in the system.

## Overview

This microservice allows users to:
- Place an order and process payment.
- Retrieve order details by order ID.

## Dependencies

This project utilizes several dependencies to function correctly. Key dependencies include:

- **`Spring Boot Starter Web`**: For building web applications, including RESTful services.
- **`Spring Boot Starter Data JPA`**: For data persistence using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.
- **`Spring Boot Starter Eureka Client`**: For service discovery with Netflix Eureka.
- **`Spring Cloud Config`**: For externalized configuration management in a microservices architecture.
- **`H2 Database`**: An in-memory database for development and testing.
- **`Lombok`**: For reducing boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, and constructors.
- **`RestTemplate`**: For synchronous client-side HTTP access.

Refer to the `pom.xml` file for all required dependencies.
